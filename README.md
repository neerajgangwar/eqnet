}
```

The code is written in Python 3.5 using Theano.

To train an eqnet run
```
python encoders/rnn/trainsupervised.py <trainingFileName> <validationFileName>
```
a `.pkl` file will be produced containing the trained network. Data files (in `.json.gz` format) can be found [here](http://groups.inf.ed.ac.uk/cup/semvec/).

To test any network implementing the `AbstractEncoder` interface, use the following command.
```
python encoders/evaluation/knnstats.py <encoderPkl> <evaluationFilename> <allFilename>
```

Note that for running all Python code, you need to add all the repository packages to the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable.


Generating Synthetic Data
-----
If you wish to generate synthetic (expression) data, look a the code in the `data.synthetic` package [here](https://github.com/mast-group/eqnet/tree/master/data/synthetic).

Requirements
-----
With Python 3.5.6, the following versions were required to make it work:
* Theano 1.0.5
* SciPy 1.1.0
* pygpu 0.7.0
* NumPy 1.18.5
* mako 1.0.7
* [Experimenter](https://github.com/mallamanis/experimenter)
